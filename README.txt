My adventures moving restEst to BuildR:

JEE 6 and maven1 repositories are not sweet friends of BuildR.

Glassfish has it's own repository at download.java.net/maven/glassfish.

My JRuby install uses is Ruby 1.8.7 compliant, which means that is ships with a bugged-to-hell REXML. This leads to a fatal "REXML::UndefinedNamespaceException : Undefined prefix xsi found" error. It also means that I can't do any more with JRuby, unless there's a 1.8.6 compliant version available... 

Trying Ruby 1.8.6.

Not awed yet.

Sourceforge is not letting me download mingw. This is not going well.
